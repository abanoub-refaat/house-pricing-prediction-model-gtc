# House Price Prediction - GTC Internship

This project is part of my **GTC Internship in Machine Learning**. The goal is to develop a predictive model that estimates house prices based on different property and location features.

## Project Overview

Accurately predicting house prices is important for buyers, sellers, and real estate agents.

In this project, I:

- Explored and cleaned the dataset.
- Performed **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)** to understand feature importance.
- Engineered new features to enhance model performance.
- Trained and tested multiple machine learning models.
- Evaluated results using regression performance metrics.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **NumPy & Pandas** â†’ Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** â†’ Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** â†’ ML models and evaluation
- **Jupyter Notebook** â†’ Experimentation

## Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values
   - Encode categorical variables
   - Normalize/scale numerical data
   - Detect and treat outliers
2. **EDA**
   - Visualize feature distributions
   - Correlation analysis
   - Identify key predictors
3. **Modeling**
   - Linear Regression
   - Random Forest Regressor
   - Gradient Boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM)
   - Compare results
4. **Evaluation**
   - Metrics: RMSE, MAE, RÂ²

- Top features impacting house prices were **[list top features]**.

## ðŸš€ Future Improvements

- Hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy
- Adding more external features (e.g., neighborhood info, economic indicators)
- Deploying the model as a web app (Flask/Streamlit)
